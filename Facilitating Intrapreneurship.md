# Facilitating Intrapeneurship in Large Organizations
**Aksel Gresvig, Accenture**

## Background
Accenture is a large organization. The world's largest consulting firm, in fact. We offer a wide spectrum of services, but in my department, *Architecture, Delivery & Integration*, we care most about techonology. We care about delivering solid technical solutions to our customers. To do that, we need inspired, motivated colleagues who have a passion for the technologies that drive our products, and who continually strive to improve on earlier experiences.

So how do we do that? Many factors affect employee satisfaction, but disregarding the given ones (like market competitive compensation and benefits, for instance), then something we've been really fousing on offering our colleagues lately is motivation through *arenas for innovation and creativity*. And we've done so by *facilitating intrapeneurship*.

That is what this article is about; why intrapeneurship and how we've created these arenas.


## Why?
Getting a bunch of engineers, colleagues, and/or friends together who share a passion for technology immediately creates a great platform for knowledge sharing and skill building. With an informal atmosphere, where the purpose is TBD and the goals arent pre-defined or at least highly moldable, motivation rises. The participants want to GSD. Add some further incentives like for instance pay, pizza & beer, gadgets or whatever is feasible, some very powerful synergies come into play. 

I call this an arena for innovation and creativity. It is a context that *facilitates intrapeneurship*.

### Our challenge as a large corporation
Our customers are typically large organizations in the public and private sectors. The engagements we have with them are time- and cost-critical, and often longer running. They are not the ideal arena for trial and error, for experimenting and testing. 

We need to create these arenas ourselves. That way we help our colleagues stay up to date in their fields, outside of the 9 to 5. Passion is essential to do work-like stuff after work, but that is all that is necessary - a little passion. Our arenas facilitate the rest.

### Acquiring knowledge, building skill
We create arenas like these to build skill and share knowledge. This is extremely valuable to us when trying to stay up to date in an increasingly competitive business.

### Stimulating talent
In this arena, creativity and innovation can flow freely without the burden of deadlines, the hindrances of project specifications, or pressure that comes with customer engagements. This stimulates talent. It makes our colleagues happy.

This helps us keep our talented colleagues, who at any time are the target of hungry recruiters for our many competitors.

### Branding & networking
We open up our collaborative sessions. We put stuff on GitHub, we share our project experiences, hold guest lectures about cool tech at schools, and we arrange open meetups. People see us. This way we attract new talent, so it's a great recruiting tool.

Moreover, this lays the groundwork for easy networking with like-minded individuals. There are a lot of tech-heads here in Oslo, not to mention on the ol' Internet, that share our passion for the possibilities offered by cutting-edge technology. We learn a lot from them, and now they learn a bit from us. We make friends in the process, and the synergies are awesome. It is the open-source mentality that we've seen so much great come out of.

### Sales
Innovation involves risk, but when doing innovative stuff in controlled environments backed by your employer, the risk is mitigated. Here we can try out whatever we want in the software paradigm, if the application doesn't ship no-one gets angry. The goal is to create something we can show off of course, but if the new framework we chose simply wasn't mature enough, so what? We still learned a ton.

This gives us confidence when talking to clients. It lets us claim experience with solutions that we haven't sold before. It makes it more feasible for us to leverage the latest of todays and tomorrows technology, and enables our clients to stay technologially agressive and provide their customers modern products. Its a triple win.
